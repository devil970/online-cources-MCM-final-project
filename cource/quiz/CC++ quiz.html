            <div class="question">
                <p>1. What is the correct syntax for declaring a variable in C?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) int myVariable;<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> b) var myVariable = 0;<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> c) let myVariable;<br>

                <p>2. What is the difference between int and float data types in C?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) int is used to store whole numbers, while float is used to store decimal numbers.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) int is more precise than float.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> c) int is faster than float.<br>
    
                <p>3. What is the difference between a function and a macro in C?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> a) A function can have parameters, while a macro cannot<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> b) A function is a block of code that can be reused, while a macro is a single line of code that is expanded at compile time<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> c) A function can return a value, while a macro cannot.<br>

                <p>4. What is the difference between #include and #define directives in C?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> a) #include is used to include header files, while #define is used to define macros.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> b) #include directives are processed at compile time, while #define directives are processed by the preprocessor.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> c) #include directives can be used to include multiple files, while #define directives can only be used to define a single macro.<br>

                <p>5. What is the difference between main() and int main(void) in C?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> a) main() is a function that must be present in every C program, while int main(void) is a function that can be used to return a value.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> b) main() is the entry point of all C programs, while int main(void) is a function that is called by the operating system when the program is executed<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> c) main() can have parameters, while int main(void) cannot.<br>

                <p>6. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> a) A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while a struct is a data structure<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> b) A class can have member functions, while a struct cannot.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> c) A class can have protected and private members, while a struct cannot<br>

                <p>7. What is the difference between a constructor and a destructor in C++?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> a) A constructor is used to initialize the properties of an object, while a destructor is used to clean up the resources used by an object.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> b) A constructor is called when an object is created, while a destructor is called when an object is destroyed. <br>
                <input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> c) Both constructors and destructors can have parameters.<br>

                <p>8. What is inheritance in C++?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> a) Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes that inherit the properties and methods of existing classes.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> b) Inheritance is a way to reuse code and create more complex objects<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> c) Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.
                <br>

                <p>9. What is polymorphism in C++?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> a) Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many different forms.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> b) Polymorphism is the ability of a method to be overridden by subclasses.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> c) Polymorphism is the ability of a variable to hold objects of different types.<br>

                <p>10. What is the difference between a reference and a pointer in C++?</p>
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> a) A reference must be initialized when it is declared, while a pointer does not need to be initialized.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> b) A reference cannot be reassigned, while a pointer can be reassigned.<br>
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> c) Both<br>
